  <div class="section" id="is-linux-kernel-free-software">
    <h2>Is EMF Automated Testing Lab Free Software?</h2>
    <p>EMF Automated Testing Lab is released under GNU GPL version 2 and is therefore Free
    Software as defined by the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a>.
    You may read the entire copy of the license in the file distributed with each release
    of the EMF Automated Testing Lab.</p>

  <div class="section" id="what-does-stable-and-canary-mean">
    <h2>What does &quot;stable&quot; and &quot;canary&quot; mean?</h2>
    <p>As EMF Automated Testing Lab move from the &quot;canary&quot; into the &quot;stable&quot; category, two
    things can happen:</p>
    <ol class="arabic simple">
      <li>They can reach &quot;End of Life&quot; after a few bugfix revisions, which
      means that maintainers will release no more bugfixes for this version, or</li>
      <li>They can be put into &quot;master&quot; maintenance, which means that
      maintainers will provide bugfixes for this revision for a
      much longer period of time.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If the EMF Automated Testing Lab version you are using is marked &quot;master,&quot; you should consider
    upgrading to the next major version as there will be no more bugfixes
    provided for the kernel version you are using.</p>
    <p>Please check the <a href="./release.html">Releases</a> page for more info.</p>

  <div class="section" id="is-there-an-rss-feed-for-the-latest-tools-version">
    <h2>Is there an RSS feed for the latest tools version?</h2>

  </div>

  <div class="section" id="can-i-get-an-owner-account-for-the-repository">
    <h2>Can I get an owner account for the repository?</h2>
    <p>Owner accounts are not given away very often, usually you need to
    be making some reasonable amount of contributions to the EMF Automated
    Testing Lab and have a good reason for wanting / needing an account. If
    you really feel that you should have an account please e-mail the following to
    <a class="reference external" href="mailto:blade&#64;hit.edu.cn">blade&#64;hit.edu.cn</a>:</p>
    <ul class="simple">
      <li>full name</li>
      <li>desired username</li>
      <li>reason for requiring an owner account</li>
      <li>reference to work you've done</li>
      <li>PGP/GPG public key fingerprint (NOT your ssh key)<ul>
      <li>Key should be signed by as many developers as you know</li>
      <li>Accounts will not be issued until key carries enough signatures</li>
      <li>Key and signatures must be available on public key servers</li>
    </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>The admin team will then review your request and let you know
    the decision.</p>

  <div class="section" id="i-have-cool-project-x-can-you-guys-mirror-it-for-me">
    <h2>I have cool project X, can you guys mirror it for me?</h2>
    <p>Probably not. We do not mirror individual projects, software, etc as
    we feel there are better places providing mirrors for those kinds of
    repositories. If you feel we should mirror your project, please contact
    <a class="reference external" href="mailto:weibohit&#64;163.com">weibohit&#64;163.com</a> with the following information:</p>
    <ul class="simple">
    <li>name</li>
    <li>project name</li>
    <li>project website</li>
    <li>detailed project description</li>
    <li>reason for wanting us to mirror</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The admin team will then review your request and talk to you
    about it. As with any kind of account it's up to the discretion of the admin team.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="how-does-kernel-org-provide-its-users-access-to-the-git-trees">
    <h2>How does admins provide its users access to the git trees?</h2>
    <p>We are using an access control system called <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite/wiki">gitolite</a>, originally
    written and maintained by Sitaram Chamarty. We chose gitolite for a
    number of reasons:</p>
    <ul class="simple">
    <li>Limiting of ssh access to the system</li>
    <li>Fine grained control over repository access</li>
    <li>Well maintained and supported code base</li>
    <li>Responsive development</li>
    <li>Broad and diverse install base</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As well at the time of deployment the code had undergone an external
    code review.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="when-will-the-next-stable-be-released">
    <h2>When will the next stabe be released?</h2>
    <p>The next stabe will be released when it is ready. There is no strict
  timeline for making releases.
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="what-will-go-into-the-next-release">
    <h2>What will go into the next release?</h2>
    <p>It is hard to predict with certainty, but you can either take a peek at
    Corbet provides a broad forecast of what will likely be included into
    the next mainline release.</p>
